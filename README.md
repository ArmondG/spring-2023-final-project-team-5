# Project Overview
# Our final project was line following while utilizing LIDAR and the OakD Lite Camera for obstacle and pedestrian avoidance inside of ROS2. The car would have different reactions depending on whether it detected a person or a cone. If a cone was detected the car would simply move around the cone either to the left or right. If a person was detected the car would stop completely until a person is no longer detected.
