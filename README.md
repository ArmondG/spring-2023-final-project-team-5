# Team 5 Final Project: Obstacle and Pedestrian Avoidance Within ROS2 

## TEAM MEMBERS
### **Shasta Subramanian - Computer Engineering**
### **Armond Greenberg - Mechanical Engineering**
### **Jacob Cortez - Mechanical Engineering**
### **Zixu Hao - Electrical Engineering (UPS Student)**

## Project Abstract
### Our final project was themed primarily around obstacle avoidance utilizing the LIDAR and OakD Lite Camera.
### *What We Promised*
* Obstacle avoidance where if the obstacle is not a person the robot swerves around the around continues on its path using LIDAR
* If a pedestrian is detected the robot will stop until a person is no longer detected using the OakD Lite Camera
* The previous two objectives would also be achieved while line following and within ROS2
### Challenges
* Incorporating all of the various files, publishers, and subscribers within ROS2

### Accomplishments
* We were able to achieve all of our promised goals successfully and had time to fine tune and refine our robot.
* Our robot is able to consistently perform its obstacle avoidance and pedestrian detection in ROS2.
